This autumn feels like funeral to me
The longest song of grief
And not for what has passed
But for what shall last
Exhausted nature is tragic and suicidal!
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself!

 Goodbye!
May we see each other next time
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life!
Then as now fly!
Today you reached the point of no return
Now cry! And then die!
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored
Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion
Under permanent ice we found breathless paradise
No, we’re not dead
No, we’re not dead
Just enjoying coma
From the ashes of my roots the new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth, this is poetry of me and you!
